## A practical assignment for learning how to use Mongoose ODM for database interactions 
     
**Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling)** is a library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a schema-based solution for modeling application data. Mongoose ODM serves as a bridge between MongoDB and Node.js, offering a straightforward way to define schemas for MongoDB collections, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and enforce data validation.   
   
Mongoose uses JavaScript objects known as schemas. These schemas define the structure of data, including the types of each field, default values, validation rules, and more. Mongoose also provides a rich set of features such as middleware, query building, and schema inheritance.   
   
Overall, Mongoose ODM simplifies working with MongoDB in Node.js applications by providing a structured approach to data modeling and interaction with the database.    
    
For this assignment [Node Backend Starter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-backend-starter) was used.

**Node Backend Starter** is an application for generating standard MVC structured NodeJS, Mongoose, & Express backend server.

**Installation:**
 
run **npm i -g node-backend-starter** to installs a node-backend-starter globally on your system using npm

To intialize your starter backend code, navigate to the desired location in you file system and run **backend-init** command. Then node-backend-starter will prompt you for:   
The project name      
Port number        
Mongo URI
